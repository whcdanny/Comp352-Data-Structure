The first algorithm uses four times recursion that is there are 4 recursive calls at the end of the function, therefore it is of exponential complexity. The second algorithm uses linear recursion,there is only one recursive call at the end of the function, therefore the second algorithm solves that it saves the 3 previous numbers in the sequence and computes the next one, instead of computing the 4 numbers every time.
